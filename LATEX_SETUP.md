# LaTeX Development Setup for VSCode

This repository is configured to support LaTeX document editing and compilation in Visual Studio Code.

## Prerequisites

1. **Install LaTeX Distribution:**
   - **Windows:** Install [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/) or [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)
   - **macOS:** Install [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/)
   - **Linux:** Install TeX Live via your package manager:
     ```bash
     # Ubuntu/Debian
     sudo apt-get install texlive-full
     
     # Fedora
     sudo dnf install texlive-scheme-full
     
     # Arch Linux
     sudo pacman -S texlive-most
     ```

2. **Install VSCode Extensions:**
   
   When you open this repository in VSCode, you'll be prompted to install recommended extensions. Accept the prompt, or manually install:
   - [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) - The main LaTeX extension
   - [PDF Viewer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mathematic.vscode-pdf) - Additional PDF viewing capabilities

## How to Use

### Creating and Editing LaTeX Files

1. Create a new `.tex` file in your repository
2. Start writing your LaTeX document
3. The file will automatically compile on save (configured in `.vscode/settings.json`)

### Viewing PDFs

The PDF viewer is configured to open in a VSCode tab. There are several ways to view your compiled PDF:

1. **Automatic viewing:** After saving, the PDF will automatically open/update in a tab
2. **Manual viewing:** 
   - Right-click on the `.tex` file → "View LaTeX PDF"
   - Use the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`) → "LaTeX Workshop: View LaTeX PDF"
3. **External viewer:** Right-click PDF in explorer → "Open LaTeX PDF in external viewer"

### SyncTeX (Syncing between source and PDF)

- **Forward sync (source → PDF):** `Ctrl+Alt+J` (or `Cmd+Option+J` on macOS)
- **Backward sync (PDF → source):** Double-click on the PDF

### Build Recipes

The following build recipes are available:

1. **pdflatex** - Quick compilation with pdflatex
2. **pdflatex → bibtex → pdflatex × 2** - Full compilation with bibliography
3. **xelatex** - For documents requiring Unicode or special fonts
4. **latexmk** - Automatic build tool that handles dependencies

To select a recipe:
- Command palette → "LaTeX Workshop: Build with recipe"

### Cleaning Build Artifacts

- **Auto-clean:** Configured to clean auxiliary files after each build
- **Manual clean:** Command palette → "LaTeX Workshop: Clean up auxiliary files"

## Configuration Files

- `.vscode/settings.json` - LaTeX Workshop configuration
- `.vscode/extensions.json` - Recommended extensions
- `.gitignore` - Excludes LaTeX build artifacts from version control

## Troubleshooting

### PDF viewer doesn't open

1. Ensure LaTeX Workshop extension is installed and enabled
2. Check that your LaTeX distribution is installed correctly:
   ```bash
   pdflatex --version
   ```
3. Try rebuilding: Command palette → "LaTeX Workshop: Build LaTeX project"
4. Check the LaTeX Workshop output panel for errors (View → Output → LaTeX Workshop)

### Compilation errors

1. Check the "Problems" panel (`Ctrl+Shift+M` or `Cmd+Shift+M`)
2. View detailed logs: Command palette → "LaTeX Workshop: View LaTeX compiler log"
3. Ensure all required LaTeX packages are installed

### SyncTeX not working

1. Verify that `-synctex=1` is in the build args (already configured)
2. Ensure the PDF was generated by the current VSCode session
3. Try rebuilding the document
